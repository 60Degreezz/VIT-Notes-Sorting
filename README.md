VIT NOTES SORTER

As we all know VTOP files can be a mess sometimes. With there long file names and all being saved in the download folder it becomes hard to even find a single file. This program strives to fix this very issue.

This program sorts the files into a well organized structure which is very user friendly and helps you find the files really fast. On top of that it also shortens the file name to a more readable format.

Steps to follow after installation:
1. Once installation is complete run the program.
2. You will be prompted with an UI asking to fill the Sorting location and Download location.
3. Sorting location is the directory in which you want the sorted files to be stored.
4. Download location is the directory where you're web-brower downloads the VTOP files.
5. Fill in these fields and click OK.
6. Now the program is set and will be working behind the scene to make your life a bit easier.
