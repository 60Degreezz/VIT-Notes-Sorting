# VIT-Notes-Sorting

## Why I made it

Like any other VITian I am way too dependant on prof notes compared to what is actually taught in class. Now VTOP is a good platform and is rather a good medium for note sharing.

BUT the file names when you download the notes. THEY ARE TOOOO LONG. I really hated that. Plus finding the notes for a subject in the downloads folder 5 mins before you have to leave for exam is impossible. So I made this program.
It basically keeps an eye on the downloads folder, whenever it sees notes downloaded from VTOP it picks it up, shortens the name and puts it in a well organized folder system. This makes life a lot easier. All your notes are there in well sorted and with human readable names.

Give it a try I swear you wont be able to live without it once you get used to its convinience.


## A bit about setting it up

The file you have is mostly a .exe setup file if not check the latest release on the git repo. Run the file, you will get the standard program installation prompts. Install it like you would install any other program.

And that's it, only one more step before you can forget your VTOP troubles.

When the application runs for the first time it will give open a window something like this:

You have to enter locations for 2 folders here.
First is the downloads folder i.e. the default folder in which all the files from VTOP get downloaded into. This is where the program will hunt for those VTOP files.
And the second one is the folder in which you want the program to save all your sorted files. (Do not create a seperate folder for this as the program will create a seperate folder for you).

Thats it, it's done!!

Now this program will run in the background and sort your files without you knowing about it.

For the people who are sceptical about how the subjects will be managed here are some live pics from my laptop:

## Yes there are some limitations

As I made this program for myself initially. I haven't really considered what you guys might want. And so i need your feedback. Pls do tell me what you like or dont like about the program and also if there are any bugs.

P.S. I have been using this program for the last 2 yrs and I literally cannot live without it.
