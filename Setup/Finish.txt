VIT NOTES SORTER

As we all know VTOP files can be a mess sometimes. With there long file names and all being saved in the download folder it becomes hard to even find a single file. This program strives to fix this very issue.

This program sorts the files into a well organized structure which is very user friendly and helps you find the files really fast. On top of that it also shortens the file name to a more readable format.

Steps to follow after installation:

5. Fill in these fields and click OK.
6. Now the program is set and will be working behind the scene to make your life a bit easier.
